## Getting Started

Before starting, make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm

### Installation

To install the project dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```
## Usage

To start the application in development mode, run:

```bash
npm start

This will start the application in your default browser at http://localhost:5173.
If the port 5173 is already being used, Vite will automatically try the next available port so this may not be the actual port the server ends up listening on.
